# 🔧 Entity Metadata Fix Applied

## ✅ Issue Identified

The error `No metadata for "User" was found` occurred because TypeORM couldn't load entities using the wildcard path pattern `__dirname + '/**/*.entity{.ts,.js}'`.

This commonly happens when:
- The build process changes file paths
- Running compiled code vs. source code
- Path resolution issues in Windows

## 🛠️ Fix Applied

Changed from wildcard entity loading to explicit imports:

**Before:**
```typescript
entities: [__dirname + '/**/*.entity{.ts,.js}']
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Explicit imports at top of file
import { User } from './modules/users/entities/user.entity';
import { Station } from './modules/stations/entities/station.entity';
// ... all other entities

// Then in TypeORM config:
entities: [
  User,
  Station,
  Fournisseur,
  // ... all entities explicitly listed
]
```

## 🚀 Action Required

### Restart the Backend
```powershell
# Stop backend (Ctrl+C)
cd backend
npm run start:dev
```

### Expected Success Messages
You should see:
```
[Nest] LOG [InstanceLoader] TypeOrmModule dependencies initialized
[Nest] LOG [InstanceLoader] AuthModule dependencies initialized
[Nest] LOG [NestApplication] Nest application successfully started
```

### Test the Login
1. Try logging in from http://localhost:4200
2. Or run: `cd backend && .\test-endpoints.bat`

## ✨ Expected Result

The backend console should now show:
```
Login attempt: nicole@embadif.com
Login successful for: nicole@embadif.com
```

And the frontend should receive a successful login response with JWT token!

## 📝 Why This Happened

The direct test script worked because it created its own application context and TypeORM could find entities in that context. But when running the HTTP server, the entity metadata wasn't being loaded properly due to the path pattern issue.

Explicit imports ensure all entities are loaded correctly regardless of the runtime environment.
