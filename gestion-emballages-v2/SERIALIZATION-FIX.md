# 🔧 Serialization Fix Applied

## ✅ Issue Identified

The 500 error was caused by the auth service trying to manually create a UserResponseDto with getter properties (`isManager`, `isGestionnaire`, etc.) that don't exist when the object is created manually.

## 🛠️ Fix Applied

Changed the auth service to return the User entity directly and let the ClassSerializerInterceptor handle the transformation automatically.

**Before:**
```typescript
const userResponse: UserResponseDto = {
  id: user.id,
  // ... manually copying all properties including getters
  isManager: user.isManager, // This fails!
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
const userResponse = user; // Let class-transformer handle it
```

## 🚀 Action Required

### 1. Restart the Backend
```powershell
# Stop backend (Ctrl+C)
cd backend
npm run start:dev
```

### 2. Test the Fix
Run the controller test:
```powershell
cd backend
.\run-controller-test.bat
```

Or test from the frontend:
- Go to http://localhost:4200
- Login with nicole@embadif.com / password123

## 📝 How This Works

1. The User entity has getter methods (`isManager`, etc.)
2. When we manually create an object, these getters don't exist
3. ClassSerializerInterceptor tries to serialize them and fails
4. By passing the actual User entity, the getters work correctly
5. The `@Exclude()` decorator on `passwordHash` ensures it's not sent to the client

## ✨ Expected Result

The login should now work correctly and return:
```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbG...",
  "user": {
    "id": "58b2821c-...",
    "email": "nicole@embadif.com",
    "nomComplet": "Nicole Lang",
    "role": "Gestionnaire",
    "isActive": true,
    "isManager": false,
    "isGestionnaire": true,
    "isStation": false,
    "isFournisseur": false
  }
}
```

The `passwordHash` will be automatically excluded from the response.
