# 🔧 Internal Server Error (500) Fix

## ✅ Problem Identified and Fixed

The backend was throwing a 500 error because the auth service was trying to load relations (`station` and `fournisseur`) that no longer exist after implementing the polymorphic relationship pattern.

## 🛠️ Changes Made

### 1. Fixed `auth.service.ts`
Removed relation loading from:
- `validateUser()` method
- `getProfile()` method

### 2. Fixed `jwt.strategy.ts`
Removed relation loading from:
- `validate()` method

## 🚀 Action Required

### 1. Restart the Backend
The backend needs to be restarted to pick up these changes:

```powershell
# Stop the backend (Ctrl+C in backend terminal)
# Then restart:
cd backend
npm run start:dev
```

### 2. Wait for Confirmation
Look for these messages:
```
[Nest] LOG [NestApplication] Nest application successfully started
Application is running on: http://localhost:3000/api/v1
```

### 3. Test the Login Again
- Go to http://localhost:4200
- Login with:
  - Email: nicole@embadif.com
  - Password: password123

## 🔍 What Was Happening

1. Frontend sends login request to backend ✅
2. Backend receives request and tries to validate user ✅
3. Backend tries to load `user.station` and `user.fournisseur` relations ❌
4. These relations don't exist anymore (polymorphic relationship) ❌
5. TypeORM throws error → 500 Internal Server Error ❌

## ✨ Expected Result After Fix

1. Login request sent to backend ✅
2. Backend validates credentials ✅
3. Backend returns JWT token ✅
4. Frontend redirects to dashboard ✅

## 📝 Additional Notes

The polymorphic relationship means:
- Users have `entiteType` and `entiteId` fields
- No direct foreign key to station/fournisseur tables
- Relations are resolved programmatically when needed

## 🧪 Quick Test Command

After restarting the backend, you can test the auth endpoint directly:

```powershell
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{\"email\":\"nicole@embadif.com\",\"password\":\"password123\"}'
```

You should receive a JSON response with:
- `accessToken`: JWT token
- `user`: User object with role and permissions
