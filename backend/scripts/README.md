# Database Maintenance Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for database maintenance and data cleanup.

## MinIO Bucket Policy Management

If you're getting "Erreur lors du chargement de l'image" errors when viewing images, it's likely because the MinIO bucket is private.

### Quick Fix

1. Make sure MinIO is running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d minio
   ```

2. Update the bucket policy to public:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node scripts/update-minio-policy.js
   ```

3. Test MinIO access:
   ```bash
   node scripts/check-minio-access.js
   ```

### Manual Fix via MinIO Console

1. Access MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001
2. Login with credentials from `.env` file:
   - Username: `minioadmin`
   - Password: `minioadmin123`
3. Navigate to the `documents` bucket
4. Click on "Access Policy" or "Bucket Policy"
5. Set to "Public" or add the custom policy

### Why This Happens

- MinIO buckets are private by default
- The application tries to set a public policy on startup, but this might fail
- Docker container restarts can sometimes reset bucket policies
- The policy needs to allow both `s3:GetObject` and `s3:ListBucket` actions

## Duplicate Designations Cleanup

### Problem
Over time, articles with identical designations (product names) may be created, leading to confusion and data inconsistency. This commonly happens when:
- Multiple users create similar products
- Data imports create duplicates
- Manual entry errors occur

### Solution
These scripts help identify and fix duplicate article designations by:
1. Finding articles with identical designations
2. Keeping the first active article (oldest creation date)
3. Marking all other duplicates as inactive (`isActive: false`)

## Scripts Available

### 1. Preview Script (Safe - No Changes)
**File:** `preview-duplicate-designations.js`
**Purpose:** Analyze and preview what would be changed without making modifications

```bash
# Using npm script (recommended)
npm run fix:duplicates:preview

# Or direct execution
node scripts/preview-duplicate-designations.js
```

**Output Example:**
```
üìä PREVIEW: Found 3 designations with duplicates:
üîç This is what WOULD be changed (NO MODIFICATIONS MADE)

üìù Designation: "Bottle 500ml" (3 articles)
   ‚úÖ WOULD KEEP: BTL001 (ID: 507f1f77bcf86cd799439011)
      üìÖ Created: 12/1/2023
      üîÑ Currently Active: true
      üè™ Suppliers: 2
   ‚ùå WOULD DEACTIVATE: BTL002 (ID: 507f1f77bcf86cd799439012)
      üìÖ Created: 12/15/2023
      üè™ Suppliers: 1
   ‚ùå WOULD DEACTIVATE: BTL003 (ID: 507f1f77bcf86cd799439013)
      üìÖ Created: 1/5/2024
      üè™ Suppliers: 0
```

### 2. Fix Script (Makes Changes)
**File:** `fix-duplicate-designations.js`
**Purpose:** Actually fix the duplicates by deactivating them

```bash
# Using npm script (recommended)
npm run fix:duplicates:apply

# Or direct execution
node scripts/fix-duplicate-designations.js
```

**Interactive Confirmation:**
```
üöÄ Starting duplicate designation cleanup...
‚ö†Ô∏è  This script will mark duplicate articles as inactive (isActive = false)
üìã Strategy: Keep the first active article, deactivate all others with same designation

Do you want to proceed? (y/N):
```

---

## Logic & Strategy

### Selection Criteria
The script uses this priority order to choose which article to keep:

1. **Active Status**: Active articles are preferred over inactive ones
2. **Creation Date**: Among articles with the same active status, the oldest is kept
3. **First Match**: If all else is equal, the first one found is kept

### What Gets Updated
For each duplicate article that gets deactivated:
- `isActive` ‚Üí `false`
- `updatedAt` ‚Üí current timestamp
- `notes` array ‚Üí adds a system note explaining the deactivation

### Safety Features
- **Preview Mode**: Always preview changes before applying
- **Interactive Confirmation**: Requires user confirmation before making changes
- **Detailed Logging**: Shows exactly what will be/was changed
- **Verification**: Checks results after completion
- **Rollback Info**: Maintains audit trail for potential rollbacks

## Before Running

### Prerequisites
1. **Backup Database**: Always backup your database before running data modification scripts
2. **Environment Setup**: Ensure your `.env` file is configured with correct `MONGO_URI`
3. **Node Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are available

### Recommended Workflow
```bash
# Step 1: Preview what would be changed (safe)
npm run fix:duplicates:preview

# Step 2: Review the output carefully
# Step 3: If you're satisfied, run the fix
npm run fix:duplicates:apply

# Step 4: Verify results
npm run fix:duplicates:preview  # Should show no duplicates
```

## Output Interpretation

### Icons & Status Indicators
- ‚úÖ **KEEPING**: Article that will remain active
- ‚ùå **DEACTIVATED**: Article that was marked inactive
- ‚ö™ **ALREADY INACTIVE**: Article that was already inactive
- üîç **PREVIEW MODE**: No changes made, showing analysis only
- üìä **Statistics**: Summary of changes made/to be made

### Statistics Section
```
üìà SUMMARY:
   ‚Ä¢ Duplicate designations found: 5

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Database Connection Error**
```
‚ùå MongoDB connection error: MongooseServerSelectionError: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND mongodb
```
**Solutions**:
- **Check MongoDB is running**: Ensure MongoDB service is started locally
- **Local vs Docker**: Scripts use `MONGO_URI_LOCAL` first, then fallback to `MONGO_URI`
- **Connection string**: Verify the correct connection string in `.env`:
  ```env
  # For local MongoDB
  MONGO_URI_LOCAL=mongodb://localhost:27017/gestionEmballages
  
  # For Docker MongoDB (container name "mongodb")
  MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongodb:27017/gestionEmballages
  ```

**2. Check MongoDB Status**:
```bash
# On Windows (if MongoDB installed as service)
net start MongoDB

# Or check if process is running
tasklist /fi "imagename eq mongod.exe"

# Test connection manually
mongo --eval "db.version()"
```

**2. Permission Issues**
```
‚ùå Error fixing duplicate designations: MongoError: not authorized
```
**Solution**: Ensure your database user has write permissions

**3. No Duplicates Found**
```
‚úÖ No duplicate designations found. Database is clean!
```
**Solution**: This is good! Your database has no duplicate designations

### Recovery Options
If you need to rollback changes:
1. Check the system notes added to deactivated articles
2. Query articles with specific system notes: `db.articles.find({"notes.type": "system", "notes.text": /duplicate designation/})`
3. Reactivate articles if needed: `db.articles.updateMany({...}, {$set: {isActive: true}})`

## Environment Variables Required

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/gestion-emballages
```

## Contact & Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review the detailed console output for specific error messages
3. Ensure you have proper database backups before running fixes

**Remember**: Always run the preview script first to understand what changes will be made!

## Test Order Creation

### Create Sample Orders for Testing

**File:** `create-test-orders.js`
**Purpose:** Create sample orders to test the CommandePage display functionality

```bash
# Using npm script (recommended)
npm run test:create-orders

# Or direct execution
node scripts/create-test-orders.js
```

**What it does:**
1. Finds the first station and its user
2. Gets some articles with suppliers
3. Creates a shopping list with random quantities
4. Simulates order validation to create:
   - Individual supplier orders (Commande)
   - Global order (CommandeGlobale)
   - Frozen pricing at transaction time

**Output Example:**
```
Creating test orders...
Found station: Station A
Found 3 articles
Created shopping list with articles
Created order CMD-1704123456-7890 with amount: ‚Ç¨145.67
Created order CMD-1704123456-2345 with amount: ‚Ç¨89.32
Created global order CG-1704123456 with total amount: ‚Ç¨234.99
Test orders created successfully!
```

**Prerequisites:** 
- Run `npm run data:import` first to have stations, users, and articles
- Ensure MongoDB is running

This script is useful for testing the CommandePage amount display functionality without manually creating orders through the UI.
