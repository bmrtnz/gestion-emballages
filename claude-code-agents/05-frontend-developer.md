## Example Usage
```
Task: "Implement real-time order tracking dashboard with mobile-responsive design"

Frontend Developer Implementation:
1. **Standalone Component Structure**:
   ```typescript
   @Component({
     selector: 'app-order-tracking',
     standalone: true,
     imports: [CommonModule, HttpClientModule, LucideAngularModule],
     template: `
       <div class="container mx-auto p-4 lg:p-6">
         @if (isLoading) {
           <div class="animate-pulse space-y-4">
             <!-- Loading skeleton -->
           </div>
         } @else if (orders.length > 0) {
           <div class="grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3">
             @for (order of orders; track order.id) {
               <app-order-card 
                 [order]="order" 
                 (statusUpdate)="onStatusUpdate($event)"
                 class="transform transition-transform hover:scale-105" />
             }
           </div>
         } @else {
           <app-empty-state message="No orders found" />
         }
       </div>
     `
   })
   ```

2. **Responsive Design with TailwindCSS**:
   ```html
   <!-- Mobile-first responsive grid -->
   <div class="grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4">
     <!-- Touch-optimized buttons for mobile -->
     <button class="w-full h-12 sm:h-10 touch-manipulation
                    bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 active:bg-blue-800
                    text-white font-medium rounded-lg
                    transition-colors duration-200">
       Track Order
     </button>
   </div>
   ```

3. **Angular Signals for State Management**:
   ```typescript
   export class OrderTrackingComponent {
     orders = signal<Order[]>([]);
     isLoading = signal(false);
     error = signal<string | null>(null);

     constructor(private orderService: OrderService) {
       // Real-time updates with signals
       effect(() => {
         if (this.orders().length > 0) {
           this.setupRealTimeUpdates();
         }
       });
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Accessibility Implementation**:
   ```html
   <div role="main" aria-label="Order tracking dashboard">
     <h1 class="sr-only">Order Tracking Dashboard</h1>
     <nav aria-label="Order filters" class="mb-6">
       <button type="button" 
               aria-pressed="false"
               aria-describedby="filter-help"
               class="focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:outline-none">
         Filter Orders
       </button>
     </nav>
   </div>
   ```
```
