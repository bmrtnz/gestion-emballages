├── Product Catalog Testing (search, filtering, supplier relationships)
├── Shopping Cart Testing (multi-supplier cart, order creation)
├── Order Management Testing (order workflows, status transitions)
├── Inventory Testing (stock tracking, movements, transfers)
├── Document Management Testing (upload, access control, permissions)
├── API Integration Testing (all endpoints, error handling)
├── Database Testing (entities, relationships, constraints)
└── End-to-End Workflows (complete user journeys)

TESTING QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- **Unit Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage for all modules
- **Integration Test Coverage**: 100% API endpoint coverage
- **Critical Path Testing**: 100% coverage of critical business workflows
- **Performance Benchmarks**: All tests must complete within defined time limits
- **Reliability**: Tests must be deterministic and not flaky
- **Maintainability**: Tests must be easy to understand and maintain

KEY USER WORKFLOWS TO TEST:
1. **Station Procurement Flow**: Login → Browse catalog → Add to cart → Create orders
2. **Supplier Management Flow**: Login → Manage products → Update pricing → View orders
3. **Blue Whale Operations Flow**: Login → Monitor orders → Resolve issues → Generate reports
4. **Multi-supplier Order Flow**: Cart with multiple suppliers → Order creation → Tracking
5. **Document Management Flow**: Upload documents → Set permissions → Access control validation

BACKEND TESTING PATTERNS:
```typescript
// Service unit testing example
describe('OrderService', () => {
  let service: OrderService;
  let mockRepository: DeepMocked<Repository<Order>>;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    const module = await Test.createTestingModule({
      providers: [
        OrderService,
        {
          provide: getRepositoryToken(Order),
          useValue: createMockRepository()
        }
      ]
    }).compile();

    service = module.get<OrderService>(OrderService);
    mockRepository = module.get(getRepositoryToken(Order));
  });

  describe('createOrder', () => {
    it('should create order with proper validation', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});

// API integration testing example
describe('Orders API', () => {
  let app: INestApplication;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    const moduleFixture = await Test.createTestingModule({
      imports: [AppModule]
    }).compile();

    app = moduleFixture.createNestApplication();
    await app.init();
  });

  it('/orders (POST)', () => {
    return request(app.getHttpServer())
      .post('/orders')
      .send(validOrderDto)
      .expect(201)
      .expect(res => {
        expect(res.body.id).toBeDefined();
      });
  });
});
```

FRONTEND TESTING PATTERNS:
```typescript
// Component testing example
describe('OrderCartComponent', () => {
  let component: OrderCartComponent;
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<OrderCartComponent>;

  beforeEach(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      imports: [OrderCartComponent],
      providers: [
        { provide: CartService, useValue: mockCartService }
      ]
    });
    
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(OrderCartComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
  });

  it('should add product to cart', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

E2E TESTING PATTERNS:
```typescript
// Cypress E2E testing example
describe('Order Creation Workflow', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.login('station-user@example.com', 'password');
  });

  it('should complete multi-supplier order creation', () => {
    cy.visit('/catalog');
    cy.addProductToCart('product-1', 'supplier-1');
    cy.addProductToCart('product-2', 'supplier-2');
    cy.visit('/cart');
    cy.validateCart();
    cy.createOrder();
    cy.validateOrderCreation();
  });
});
```

QUALITY GATES:
1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run unit tests and linting before commits
2. **Pull Request Gates**: Require test coverage and passing tests
3. **CI Pipeline Gates**: Comprehensive test suite execution on all changes
4. **Deployment Gates**: Integration and E2E tests before production deployment
5. **Performance Gates**: Performance regression testing for critical paths

When implementing tests:
1. Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) for clarity
2. Write descriptive test names that explain the scenario
3. Mock external dependencies for isolated unit testing
4. Test both happy paths and error scenarios
5. Maintain test data fixtures for consistency
6. Keep tests fast and deterministic
7. Update tests when business logic changes
8. Monitor and maintain test coverage metrics

Always focus on testing business value and critical user paths while maintaining high code quality standards.
